										<h3>Neural mechanism of reference point</h3>
										<p>
											Reference point (RP) is a key concept in many decision theories, ranging from dopaminergic theories of reward prediction error to behavioral prospect theory, to psychopathological theories for major depressive disorder.
											For this study, under mentorning from <a href="https://labs.neuroscience.mssm.edu/project/rich-lab/">Dr. Erin Rich</a>, I re-analyzed the data from <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/43/33/5944.abstract">
												previously published paper
											</a> to identify the neural circuits that encode RP.
											Here, by identifying the neural evidence of the RP, we can begin to examine theoretical models and evaluate their fitness; 
											this will help us understand better the underlying computational mechanisms of decision making. Based on the location of the RP in the brain, 
											we aim to identify what input is needed to calculate/ keep track of the expected outcome; potentially shedding light on how expectations are built. 
											We also aim to discover new features of the global neural circuit for decision making by looking at the interaction between areas of RP and subjective value, 
											potentially revealing the computational mechanics of the subjective perception of options that will better explain behavioral decisions.

										<h3>Noise in Divisive Normalization model explains different context effects in value-based decision making</h3>
										<p>
											Rotation project in Dr. Paul Glimcher's lab.
											<br />
											<strong>[Summary]</strong> Context effect is how the qualities of a choice set (number of availabel options and their values) affect the chance of choosing the highest value option.
											However, there has been a controversy on the exact direction of context effects (positive/ negative/ or neutral).
											For this study, we would like to resolve this conflitct and try to understand the neural mechanism that yields this variety.

										<h3>State-space-modeling of freely foraging macaque</h3>
										<p>
											Rotation project in <a href="https://angelakilabnyu.org/">Dr. Dora Angelaki's lab</a>.
											<br />
											<strong>[Summary]</strong> Natural tasks are defined by 4 key features: 1) Including <strong>latent (hidden) variables</strong> - sensory information is merely a sampled information of real world;
											2) including <strong>uncertainty</strong> (noise) - sensory information is fundamentally unreliable represenation of real world, also neural noise;
											3) relationship between (1)-(2) is <strong>non-linear</strong> - since if they are linear, we won't need a brain to calculate information in so many steps;
											and 4) relevant temporal dynamics - actions affect future.
											<br />
											In this project, I quantified behavioral states of a natural task: freely moving foraging (see <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(21)00705-4.pdf">here</a>).
											Using state-of-the-art model: <a href="https://github.com/lindermanlab/ssm">State-space modelling</a> to quantify monkey's varied engaging state during task.

										<h3>How multisensory spatial information represented in Medial Entorhinal Cortex</h3>
										[<a href="#">PDF</a>]
										<p>
											<strong>[Abstract]</strong> Animals employ spatial information in multisensory modalities to navigate their natural environments.
											However, it is unclear whether the brain encodes such information in separate cognitive maps or integrate all into a single, universal map.
											We addressed this question in the microcircuit of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), a cognitive map of space.
											Using cellular-resolution calcium imaging, we examined the MEC of mice navigating virtual reality tracks, where visual and auditory cues provided comparable spatial information.
											We uncovered two cell types: “unimodality cells” and “multimodality cells”.
											The unimodality cells specifically represent either auditory or visual spatial information.
											They are anatomically intermingled and maintain sensory preferences across multiple tracks and behavioral states.
											The multimodality cells respond to both sensory modalities with their responses shaped differentially by auditory and visual information.
											Thus, the MEC enables accurate spatial encoding during multisensory navigation by computing spatial information in different sensory modalities and generating distinct maps.
											<br /> <br />

											This was my project during postbac at NIH in <a href="https://research.ninds.nih.gov/staff-directory/yi-gu-phd"> Dr. Yi Gu's lab</a>. The work was supported by NIH/NINDS Intramural research program.

										<h3>The role of compassion in decision making</h3>
										[<a href="#">PDF</a>]
										<p>
											<strong>[Abstract]</strong> In the study of decision-making, behavioral scientists proposed that one way to conceptualize
											how individuals make decisions is based on the outcome and the risk. However, there are other
											factors that lead us to make different choices for the same situation, such as emotion and context.
											Past studies focused on investigating the effect of each factor separately whereas recent studies
											shifted to investigating the interaction effect of different factors on decision-making. In this
											paper, we focus on the effect of compassion (as a state and dispositional tendency) and
											prosociality on decision-making in interpersonal context. We ran two studies using two different
											decision tasks: a social utility task similar to past studies (Loewenstein et al., 1989); and a
											gambling task inspired by past studies on individual decision-making (Kahneman and Tversky,
											1979). Overall, we found that prosociality and compassion have mixed effects on social
											preferences depending on different scenarios. Furthermore, although the results were mixed, our
											data supported that prosociality is associated with how people make decisions while gambling to
											win money for others. These findings implicate that there are relationships between prosociality,
											compassion and decision making.
											<br /> <br />
											This was my undergrad honors thesis. The work was financially supported by <a href="https://research.berkeley.edu/surf/">Berkeley's SURF</a>. I completed this work under mentoring from
											<a href="https://bsil.berkeley.edu/">Dr. Dacher Keltner</a> and his Graduate student, Joseph Ocampo.
